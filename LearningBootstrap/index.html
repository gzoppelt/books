                    Packt is one of the most prolific and fastgrowing
                    tech book publishers in the world.
                    Originally focused on open source software, Packt
                    pays a royalty on relevant books directly to open
                    source projects. These projects have received over
                    $400,000 as part of Packt's Open Source Royalty
                    Scheme to date.
